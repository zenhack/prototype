This is a prototype for a desktop user interface library we're building.

# Goals

* Allow for user interface design to require relatively little
  interaction between developers and designers. The designer shouldn't
  need the help of an engineer to adjust the layout of the user
  interface.
* Maintain a clean separation between interface and functionality.
* Make GUI development much less painful than it currently is.

# Concepts

* Models - essentially the same as in your standard MVC paradigm.
* Frames - a "structural" definition of the user interface - what
  widgets contain what, and what parts of the model they correspond to.
* Stylesheets - as you might expect.

TODO: expand on this.
